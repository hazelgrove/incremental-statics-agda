Preservation: actions and update steps preserve well-typedness
Progress: each well-typed program either can step or is settled 
Correctness: each well-typed, settled program agrees with from-scratch marking 
Termination: a program cannot update step forever 

Now the original big theorem follows from action commutativity
Which I don't even know how I'd express honestly
So maybe I just leave it to the above.
